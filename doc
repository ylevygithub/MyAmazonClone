(the src is the front)
(the build is the back)
(then after seting the cloud function, the functions dir becomes the backend)

    - npm i firebase

    - firebase deploy
    - firebase emulators:start
    - firebase deploy --only functions (in the functions folder (the backend after setting the cloud function))
    - firebase deploy --only hosting (in the root folder)
    - (before setting the cloud function, we will make npm run build who will create a build folder containing the hole backend that means that as soon as this folder is created, all the npm install will have to be done in that folder)
